# Project 3: Random Password Generator

## Description

This is my third assignment project for the UCI Coding Bootcamp. Working on this project helped me learn how to create variables, functions, and for loops, and if conditions in JavaScript to create a random password generator.

The purpose of this website is to generate password based on a random combination of lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters. The user is able to choose how long the password is and which types of characters are used.

## Usage

Browse the website and repository as desired.
